My React App for Assesment submission.

Following methods were used to create the following React App - 
1. This app was build using create-react-app tool.
2. Use of Hooks like - useState , useEffect for storing the data and calling an event.
3. Axios was used for fetching the data from API using .GET request.
4. Styling was done using React Bootstrap v5.2
5. A spinner is added in case of slow or delayed response from API fetching data.

It tooked me a week to make this website due to some small miscellaneous errors, which tooked me a hell of time to figure out and correct them.
